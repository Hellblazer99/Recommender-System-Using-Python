# Recommender-System-Using-Python
In this repository we will develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas. 

In the Recommender Systems notebook, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.

In the Advanced Recommender Systems notebook, we will have a more intensive walkthrough process on creating a recommendation system with Python with the same Movie Lens Data Set
